# KM Update Runbook

Use this runbook when the DSW Registry publishes a new Common DSW Knowledge
Model. The KM provides tree context and a browser-test target. It does not
constrain the version or contents of the official Weblate catalog.

## When to Start

Start after the KM version is published and available from the DSW Registry or
another official upstream source.

## Required Secret

Configure `DSW_REGISTRY_TOKEN` in the production translation repository under
GitHub Actions repository secrets before enabling the scheduled KM update
workflow. Local runs read the same token from the shell environment. See
[Security and Permissions](security-and-permissions.md).

The scheduled KM version auto-update workflow is the normal update mechanism.
The latest published Registry KM selects the context version independently of
Weblate. The bundle identity and the downloaded PO syntax/language are checked
in a temporary workspace before the active config or inputs change.
It runs `dsw-km-sync-latest-km`, no-ops when the configured KM is current, and
only pushes to Git when every safety check passes. When the Registry has a newer
published KM, the workflow:

- downloads the new KM bundle using `DSW_REGISTRY_TOKEN`;
- downloads the current Weblate PO without uploading anything to Weblate;
- checks the bundle identity and catalog format, then updates config and sources;
- rebuilds `tree/` and `builds/final_translated.po`;
- validates the PO for native DSW Knowledge Model locale import;
- validates config, runs translation tests, and checks repository alignment;
- commits and pushes to the tracking branch only after those steps pass.

If the token is missing or any validation step fails, no Git commit is pushed.
The next scheduled run will retry.

The latest Weblate catalog and Registry package need not advance together.
PO synchronization continues with the current KM when a newer bundle is not
available. Source differences are recorded for review, not rejected. Never
relabel an older bundle or rewrite official catalog headers to make them match.

For a local maintainer run, use:

```shell
export TOOL_REPO_DIR=/path/to/dsw-km-translation-tool
make -C "$TOOL_REPO_DIR" repo-km-update \
  TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR=/path/to/dsw-root-locales-zh_Hant
```

Set `TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR` as described in the
[Command Reference](command-reference.md). Override `TRACKING_BRANCH` only when
the production repository does not use `master`. The targets are declared in
the [`Makefile`][makefile].

## Manual Test or Repair Path

Use this path only when the scheduled update fails, or when you want to test a
new KM update in a disposable branch or local clone.

1. Create and check out a disposable branch in a clean translation repository.

2. Discover available versions:

   ```shell
   make -C "$TOOL_REPO_DIR" repo-km-status \
     TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR=/path/to/dsw-root-locales-zh_Hant
   ```

3. Run the same guarded updater against the disposable branch:

   ```shell
   export DSW_REGISTRY_TOKEN=...
   make -C "$TOOL_REPO_DIR" repo-km-update \
     TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR="$TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR" \
     TRACKING_BRANCH="$BRANCH_NAME"
   ```

4. Validate config and alignment if you are diagnosing a failed update:

   ```shell
   make -C "$TOOL_REPO_DIR" repo-validate \
     TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR="$TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR"
   make -C "$TOOL_REPO_DIR" repo-align \
     TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR="$TRANSLATION_REPO_DIR"
   ```

## Review Manual Branch Outputs

Review these generated files before merging:

```text
sources/knowledge-models/
sources/localize/zh_Hant/latest.po
tree/
builds/final_translated.po
reviews/
```

Pay special attention to:

- source mismatches, which may indicate changed English strings;
- missing entries, which may indicate new KM fields or removed old fields;
- newly empty translations;
- newly review-marked translations reported by Weblate.

Merge a manual branch only after it produces aligned outputs. After merge,
run `localize_alignment_report.yml` manually and check the next scheduled
`localize_auto_sync.yml` run. The sync writer has no manual trigger.
